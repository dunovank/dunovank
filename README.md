### dunovank üêª

Community college dropout & former postdoc @CarnegieMellon. Creator of jupyter-themes. Spirit animal: Toby Ziegler. My interests fall into a few different buckets: computational psychology and neuroscience (focus of my PhD), natural language processing and machine learning (what I work on now), and tinkering with UI themes (afterhours hobby).
