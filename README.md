### dunovank

My interests fall into a few different buckets: [**cognitive**](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/12/2251.abstract) and [**compuational neuroscience**](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006998) (focus of my [**PhD**](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/30628/)), NLP and deep representation learning (what I work on now), and tinkering with UI themes (afterhours hobby). 

One manifestation of said UI tinkering is the [**Jupyter-Themes**](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes) library for controlling the Jupyter Notebook's UI and syntax highlighting (see the [**Darkside Theme**](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyterlab_darkside_theme) for similar themes in Jupyter*Lab*).
